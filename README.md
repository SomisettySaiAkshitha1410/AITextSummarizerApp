## Demo

Try it live at: [AI Text Summarizer](https://aitextsummarizerapp.onrender.com/)

***

## Usage

1. Paste or type your text in the "Text to Summarize" box.
2. Enter at least 200 characters to enable the "Summarize" button.
3. Click the "Summarize" button.
4. The summarized text will appear below after processing.

You can also use the demo button to auto-fill sample text.

## How It Works

- The frontend captures text input, verifies length, and disables/enables the submit button accordingly.
- Upon submission, it sends a POST request to the Express server at `/summarize`.
- The server calls the Hugging Face API with the text and retrieves a summary using the `facebook/bart-large-cnn` model.
- The summarized text is sent back and displayed to the user.
